        comment: "As a core member of the Project Team at the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) at Hali√ß, I actively contributed to the development and implementation of innovative tech projects. My role involved collaborating with fellow team members to design, develop, and deploy applications that address real-world problems. One of the notable projects we worked on was GoldenMind, which is highlighted in the Projects section. This experience enhanced my skills in project management, teamwork, and technical problem-solving, while also allowing me to contribute to the tech community on campus.",
